Changes in version 0.6

 - Configurable charset handling based on CHS files in the GoldED+ format.

 - Greatly improved MIME-handling. JamNNTPd now handles both quoted-printable
   and base64 in both headers and message body when posting messages. Message
   headers containing non-ascii characters are encoded when displayed unless
   the -noencode option is used.

 - Now supports "quoting" with backslash as described in RFC-822.

 - New command-line option -origin

 - New command-line option -keepsoftcr

 - Support for TZUTC/TZUTCINFO kludges. Thanks to Peter Karlsson for the patch.
   New command-line option -notzutc.

 - Better parsing of configuration files. You can now use quotes for strings
   containing space characters. "" means an empty string.

 - Groups are now case-insensitive. In addition, "*" now means all groups and
   "-" means no groups.

 - Fixed response code of NEWGROUPS command.

 - LIST ACTIVE and LIST OVERVIEW.FMT are now also supported.

 - JamNNTPd now creates an X-Comment-To header line

 - The signature delimiter "-- " is no longer reflowed when posting with
   format=flowed.

 - All characters <32 are removed in the output of the XOVER command to
   prevent problems.

 - Increased the maximum size for posts from 10 000 bytes to 20 000 bytes.


Changes in version 0.5

 - Superfluous space characters are now removed when lines are joined when
   posting using format=flowed.

 - Implemented quote reformatting (-smartquote switch)

 - Changed % to $ in Message-Id and References line.

 - XOVER didn't work in groups with only one message. Fixed.

 - JAMLIB is now included in the JamNNTPd archive and no longer needs to be
   downloaded separately.

 - Simplified the compilation process. Now "make linux" or "make win32" in
   the src directory is enough.

Changes in version 0.4

 - First public release
