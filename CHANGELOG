Changes in version 1.3

 - Correct the order for how 'min' & 'max' are listed in the command
   NNTP LIST [ACTIVE] in src/nntpserv.c from 'group min max flag' to
   'group max min flag'. Reference RFC 3977 (and its ancestor RFC 977),
   where they note that 'max' comes before 'min'. Thanks go to
   Urs Jan√üen <urs@tin.org>.
   Closes https://sourceforge.net/p/ftnapps/jamnntpd/tickets/4/

 - Correct XOVER response by adding an extra '\t' character to line 1381
   of src/nntpserv.c. Thanks to mark.lewis@p0.f12.n3634.z1.fidonet.org.
   Closes https://sourceforge.net/p/ftnapps/jamnntpd/tickets/5/

 - Correct spelling of 'JamNNTd' as 'JamNNTPd' in examples/jamnntpd.users.

Changes in version 1.2

 - Make From addresses into valid RFC 5322 addresses.
 
 - JamNNTPd traditionally has used Fidonet-style addresses in the From
   header. This breaks RFC 5322 and causes some e-mail software (Alpine,
   Opera) not to display the sender address properly.
 
   This patch changes the From header to use a valid RFC 5322 syntax,
   albeit not a valid Internet e-mail address.

Changes in version 1.1

 - Ported to OS/2
 
Changes in version 1.0

 - Added support for netmail and local areas (see examples/jamnntpd.groups)
 
 - Added support for cancel messages
 
 - It is now possible to read configuration options from a file using the
   new -config option. If JamNNTPd is started without any command-line 
   arguments at all, it will read configuration options from the file 
   jamnntpd.config if it is present. A config file with the default
   options can be created with the -create option.
   
 - Introduced the -readorigin switch that makes JamNNTPd read addresses
   from the origin line instead of the JAM headers.
   
 - "To: name" can be used on the first line of posted messages to set an 
   alternative recipient name.
 
 - Added partial support for the LIST NEWSGROUPS command so that JamNNTPd 
   also works with Lynx.
 
 - JamNNTPd no longer adds an empty REPLY kludge if to MSGID was found.
 
 - Fixed -smartquote so that incorrect initials are not inserted.

 - Fixed broken backspace quoting on From line.
 
 - "jamnntpd -h" is more helpful.
 
 - Error messages were cleaned up a bit.
 
 - The Windows version now tries to display error messages instead of 
   Winsock error codes. Only works on newer versions of Windows. 
   
 - Makechs now hopefully compiles without errors on *BSD.

 - Cleaned up the build process a bit.

Changes in version 0.61

 - Fixed a bug that would cause JamNNTPd to crash when a JAM messagebase
   couldn't be opened.
   
 - Fixed a bug that would cause JamNNTPd to crash when a default charset
   had been specified in jamnntpd.groups. (Thanks Viktor!)
   
Changes in version 0.6

 - Configurable charset handling based on CHS files in the GoldED+ format. 
   
 - Greatly improved MIME-handling. JamNNTPd now handles both quoted-printable
   and base64 in both headers and message body when posting messages. Message
   headers containing non-ascii characters are encoded when displayed unless
   the -noencode option is used.

 - Now supports "quoting" with backslash as described in RFC-822.

 - JamNNTPd can now create an echomail.jam file that contains a list of all
   posted messages. The echomail.jam file can also be used as a semaphore.

 - A new -origin switch can be used to override the Organization line for
   the origin.
 
 - Support for TZUTC/TZUTCINFO kludges. JamNNTPd now creates a TZUTC kludge
   unless the -notzutc option is used. Thanks to Peter Karlsson for the patch.

 - Better parsing of configuration files. You can now use quotes for strings
   containing space characters. "" means an empty string.

 - It is now possible to override the From name on posts from authenticated
   users. It is also possible to specify a suffix that is added to the From
   name of all unauthenticated users using the -guestsuffix option.
   
 - Access groups are now case-insensitive. In addition, "*" now means all 
   groups and "-" means no groups.

 - The -smartquote option no longer removes initial space characters from 
   quoted text and inserts incorrect initials.
 
 - Fixed broken response code of NEWGROUPS command.

 - The LIST ACTIVE and LIST OVERVIEW.FMT commands are now also supported.

 - JamNNTPd now displays an X-Comment-To header line.

 - The signature delimiter "-- " is no longer reflowed when posting with
   format=flowed. Fixed display problems with long lines without spaces 
   and format=flowed.

 - All characters <32 are removed in the output of the XOVER command to
   prevent problems.

 - Increased the maximum size for posts from 10 000 bytes to 20 000 bytes.

 - JamNNTPd no longer crashes when an area cannot be opened.

 - JamNNTPd no longer crashes when trying to display messages with blank 
   JAMSFLD_FTSKLUDGE fields in the XOVER command.
  
 - The body text of posts that started with a blank line were lost in 
   previous versions. This has now been fixed.

 - Upgraded JAMLIB to version 1.3.2.
      
 - Other minor fixes and improvements.
 
Changes in version 0.5

 - Superfluous space characters are now removed when lines are joined when
   posting using format=flowed.

 - Implemented quote reformatting (-smartquote switch)

 - Changed % to $ in Message-Id and References line.

 - XOVER didn't work in groups with only one message. Fixed.

 - JAMLIB is now included in the JamNNTPd archive and no longer needs to be
   downloaded separately.

 - Simplified the compilation process. Now "make linux" or "make win32" in
   the src directory is enough.

Changes in version 0.4

 - First public release
